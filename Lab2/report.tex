% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
Hydrocarbon level is a good indicator of pollution within urban context. In this experiment, we conducted three different forms of hydrocarbon measurements in New York, New York. In the first part of the experiment, hydrocarbon within the air near the major roadways was measured to estimate the influence of vehicular traffic to air pollution. In the second part of the experiment, chlorinated hydrocarbon within soil samples was measured qualitatively to estimate the amount of insecticides and other toxic chemicals in soils. In the third part of the experiment, total hydrocarbon within soil samples was measured. Overall contamination level was high and health of urban residents are of concern.
